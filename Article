Blinking an LED Using PC Parallel Port (NASM + FreeDOS)
Project Goal (In Simple Words)

In this project, we make a small LED light turn ON and OFF using an old PC parallel port (LPT port) and assembly language.

Normally, Windows blocks direct hardware control. So we use FreeDOS, which lets us control hardware directly.

You will learn:

How parallel port pins work

How to connect LED safely

How to write simple assembly code

How to run it in FreeDOS

Why Not Windows?

Modern Windows (XP → Windows 11):

Blocks direct hardware port access

Needs special drivers

Sometimes unstable

FreeDOS:

Allows direct hardware control

No drivers needed

Best for learning low-level hardware

Understanding the Parallel Port
4
Important Points

Parallel port has:

8 Data Pins → D0 to D7 (Pins 2–9)

Ground Pins → Example Pin 25

Computer sends 0 or 1 (OFF or ON voltage).

Example:

Send 1 → Pin gives 5V → LED ON

Send 0 → Pin gives 0V → LED OFF

Default Address:

LPT1 = 0x378

LED Circuit (Very Important – Safety)
4
Parts Needed

1 LED

1 Resistor (220Ω – 330Ω recommended)

Parallel port cable / DB25 connector

Connection
LED Leg	Connect To
Long Leg (Anode)	Resistor → Pin 2
Short Leg (Cathode)	Ground (Pin 25)
Why Resistor?

Without resistor:

Too much current

Can damage port

Can burn LED

Setting Up FreeDOS + NASM
Step 1 — Install FreeDOS

Download FreeDOS

Make bootable USB

Boot PC into FreeDOS

Step 2 — Install NASM

Copy NASM files into FreeDOS drive:

C:\NASM


Main file:

NASM.EXE

Writing Assembly Code
Important Rule

DOS programs start at:

org 0x100

Simple LED Blink Code
org 0x100

mov dx, 0x378     ; LPT1 port address

mov al, 1         ; Turn LED ON
out dx, al

mov cx, 0FFFFh    ; Delay
delay:
loop delay

mov al, 0         ; Turn LED OFF
out dx, al

mov ah, 4Ch       ; Exit program
int 21h

How Code Works (Super Simple)
Code	Meaning
mov dx,378h	Select parallel port
mov al,1	Send ON signal
out dx,al	Send signal to pin
delay loop	Wait some time
mov al,0	Send OFF signal
Compile the Program

In FreeDOS:

nasm -f bin blink.asm -o blink.com

Run Program
blink


LED should:

Turn ON

Wait

Turn OFF

If LED Not Working

Check:

Correct pin wiring

Resistor connected

Correct port address (0x378)

FreeDOS booted (not Windows)

What You Learned

You learned:

Hardware control using assembly

Parallel port basics

Real I/O port programming

DOS assembly program structure

Real Life Use Cases

Same idea used in:

Industrial control

Embedded systems

Microcontrollers (Arduino works same way)

Old hardware automation

Future Improvements

You can:

Blink LED continuously

Control multiple LEDs

Control relays

Build small hardware projects

Final Simple Summary

If you remember only 4 things:

Use FreeDOS (not Windows)

Use port address 0x378

Always use resistor with LED

Use OUT instruction to control pins
